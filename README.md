**Automated Server Actions for Cleaning Bill of Materials (BOM) in Odoo**  

This repository contains Python scripts for Odoo server actions that help maintain clean and efficient Bill of Materials (BOM) by:  

- **Removing archived products** from BOM lines  
- **Detecting and removing duplicate products** in BOM components  
- **Combined cleanup action** for both archived and duplicate products  

## **Features**  

âœ” **Easy Integration** â€“ Works as an Odoo server action  
âœ” **Studio-Compatible** â€“ Can be implemented via Odoo Studio with minimal setup  
âœ” **Multi-BOM Support** â€“ Processes single or multiple BOMs at once  
âœ” **User Notifications** â€“ Provides clear feedback on cleanup results  
âœ” **Efficient ORM Queries** â€“ Optimized for performance  

## **Usage**  

1. **Remove Archived Products**  
   - Searches for BOM lines containing archived products and removes them.  

2. **Remove Duplicate Products**  
   - Detects multiple entries of the same product in a BOM and keeps only one.  

3. **Combined Cleanup (Archived + Duplicates)**  
   - Performs both actions in a single run for maximum efficiency.  

## **Implementation**  

- **Via Odoo Studio**:  
  - Create server actions and paste the provided Python code.  
  - Add buttons to BOM views for easy access.  

- **Manual XML Installation**:  
  - Deploy via custom module for better control.  

## **Why Use This?**  

âœ… **Prevents Errors** â€“ Ensures BOMs only contain active, non-duplicate components  
âœ… **Improves Performance** â€“ Clean BOMs load faster and avoid confusion  
âœ… **Maintenance-Friendly** â€“ Runs on demand or can be scheduled
